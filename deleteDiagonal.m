function [newBoard] = deleteDiagonal(board, x, y, deltaX, deltaY)
%deleteDiagonal Deletes elements along the same diagonals as cell (x,y).

%Author: Jacob Hiance
%
%Purpose: Deletes cells that lie on the same two diagonals on which cell
%         (x,y) lies. A stepsize in x and a step size in y can be specified to
%         determine the 'slope' of the diagonal that is deleted. A cell is
%         deleted by setting its value to NaN.
%
%Inputs:
%board --> The matrix on which to do the search.
%x --> The row of the cell by which to base the diagonal deletion.
%y --> The column of the cell by which to base the diagonal deletion.
%deltaX --> The horizontal step size determining how many columns to skip
%           in diagonal deletion.
%deltay --> The vertical step size determining how many rows to skip in 
%           diagonal deletion.
%
%Outputs:
%newBoard --> A matrix resulting from deleting the specified diagonals of
%             the given board matrix.

%Required Helper Functions:
%No required helper functions.

   % Initialize newBoard so it can besafely returned if it turns out that

   % Start by deleting the diagonal going in the top-right direction as
   % specified by deltaX and deltaY.
